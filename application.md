My career as an experimental high energy physicist has had a strong focus on building open source scientific software for the broader particle physics community and building scientific software ecosystems across physics and to the broader scientific open source community.
I am the Analysis Systems focus area lead of the Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP) where I lead work to create next generation Pythonic data analysis tools for particle physics and cyberinfrastructure designed to meet the challenges of the data intensive scientific research at planned High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN.
I additionally serve on the IRIS-HEP Executive Board where I work with the other board members to guide the institute towards success.
As part of my work in IRIS-HEP, and as a member of the ATLAS experiment at CERN, I am a developer and maintainer of the statistical modeling and inference library pyhf (https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyhf).
pyhf implements a family of statistical models used extensively in experimental particle physics and leverages automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration to improve inference speed while allowing for expressive modelling.
pyhf has been used across multiple subdomains of particle physics for physics publications, across multiple experimental collaborations, and in particle physics phenomenology and theory.

### Describe your background and experience relevant to being a BSSw Fellow (1000 - 1500 characters).

I am involved with multiple organizations and efforts across the open source scientific software community that are aligned with the BSSW Fellowship program's goals of promoting the best practices and tools for improving productivity and software sustainability.
I also serve as an associate editor for the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) (https://joss.theoj.org) in the scientific tracks of Physics and Engineering and Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning.
JOSS improves research software through peer review and also improves software scholarly credit and citation through providing a paper and software archive with DOIs.
I also serve on the organizing committee for the international Scientific Computing with Python conference (SciPy) since 2021, where I work with my committee members to bring the broader scientific Python community together to share research across scientific domains and organize community efforts.
In my role as a physicist in the ATLAS collaboration I also serve as the ATLAS experiment's analysis preservation contact where I both develop and teach methods of analysis and software preservation for the purposes of efficient analysis reuse under new physics models and new data.
This work has resulted in my organizing and teaching multiple workshops for the ATLAS and US ATLAS collaborations on best practices for software development and patterns for efficient software sustainability.
Similarly, in my leadership roles in IRIS-HEP I have both organized and taught at multiple training events for scientific analysis tooling, and also mentored more than ten IRIS-HEP Fellows to invest in the development and career paths of early career scientists with an interest in scientific software development.
I have also lectured at the US Research Software Sustainability Institute summer school on Research Software and Open Science on packaging and distribution of scientific software.
