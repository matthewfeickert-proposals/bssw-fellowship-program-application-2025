My career as an experimental high energy physicist has had a strong focus on building open source scientific software for the broader particle physics community and building scientific software ecosystems across physics and to the broader scientific open source community.
I am the Analysis Systems focus area lead of the Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP) where I lead work to create next generation Pythonic data analysis tools for particle physics and cyberinfrastructure designed to meet the challenges of the data intensive scientific research at planned High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN.
I additionally serve on the IRIS-HEP Executive Board where I work with the other board members to guide the institute towards success.
As part of my work in IRIS-HEP, and as a member of the ATLAS experiment at CERN, I am a developer and maintainer of the statistical modeling and inference library pyhf (https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyhf).
pyhf implements a family of statistical models used extensively in experimental particle physics and leverages automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration to improve inference speed while allowing for expressive modelling.
pyhf has been used across multiple subdomains of particle physics for physics publications, across multiple experimental collaborations, and in particle physics phenomenology and theory.
