The BSSw Fellowship program fosters and promotes practices, processes, and tools to improve developer productivity and software sustainability of scientific codes.
BSSw Fellows are selected annually based on an application process that includes the proposal of a funded activity that promotes better scientific software through a publicly available artifact.
We select at least three Fellows per year and honorable mentions as appropriate.
Each 2025 BSSw Fellow will receive up to $25,000 for an activity that promotes better scientific software.
Activities can include organizing a workshop, preparing a tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software community, including broadening participation or promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.
